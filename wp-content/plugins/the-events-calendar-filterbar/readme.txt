A premium add-on to The Events Calendar plugin (required), Filter Bar allows for additional frontend event filtering capabilities to help users better navigate your calendar.

== Description ==

<a href="http://m.tri.be/f8">The Events Calendar: Filter Bar</a> is an add-on for The Events Calendar that adds more filtering capabilities to an already robust plugin.

The Events Calendar allows you to create and manage events with ease from right within your WordPress dashboard; no shortcode is needed (nor is one available). And with The Events Calendar: Filter Bar add-on, your calendar receives a ton of new filtering options that allow users to drill down to only see certain types of events.

Filter Bar introduces a new sidebar panel that appears next to your calendar on the frontend. As users enable filters, they’re applied to the main calendar and the results narrow based on their selections. Care only about events taking place in the evening? Want to see tech meetups, not parties or pub crawls? Consider it done. With real-time AJAX filtering and dynamic URLs that you can save/share as needed, Filter Bar helps your users see the events most relevant to them.

Plus, Filter Bar users get access to our premium support forums. Need help or have a question? Post there and we'll get back to you within 24 hours (during the week). We're proud of our great support team and want to help make your calendar even better with The Events Calendar: Filter Bar.

== Installation ==

Remember, to use Filter Bar you need to also be running The Events Calendar. You'll need to follow these steps for both plugins, starting with The Events Calendar.

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins --> Add New.
2. Select the Upload option and hit "Choose File."
3. When the popup appears select the the-events-calendar-x.x.zip file or events-calendar-filter-bar.x.zip file from your desktop. (The 'x.x' will change depending on the current version number).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful. A link to access the calendar directly on the frontend will be presented here as well.
6. For access to new updates for Filter Bar, make sure you have added your valid License Key under Events --> Settings --> Licenses. You can find your license key on your tri.be account at http://m.tri.be/3u.

That's it! Just configure your settings as you see fit, and you're on your way to filtering events in style.

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.2.4 or greater (recommended: PHP 5.4 or greater)
* WordPress 3.9 or above
* jQuery 1.11.x
* The Events Calendar 3.10 or above

= Where to Begin =

If this is your first time using The Events Calendar and Filter Bar, you're in for a treat! Here are some basics we've found helpful for users jumping into it for the first time:

* The first step is installing and activating The Events Calendar. Our <a href="http://m.tri.be/18w1">New User Primer</a> will walk you through the process!
* Next, check out the Filter Bar <a href="http://m.tri.be/f9">New User Primer</a> which will take you through installing and using your new plugin.
* Our <a href="http://m.tri.be/18w0">Knowledgebase</a> includes tips, tutorials, and cool tweaks for the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar and Filter Bar. If you're running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar and Filter Bar are running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Twelve theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

If you're already a premium license holder, you're entitled access to our more actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/3x">premium forums</a> at the tri.be website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. No post should go more than 24-48 hours during that time without a response.

= What add-ons are available for The Events Calendar, and where can I read more about them? =

* <a href="http://m.tri.be/18wi">Events Calendar PRO</a>, for adding premium calendar features like recurring events, advanced views, cool widgets, shortcodes, additional fields, and more!
